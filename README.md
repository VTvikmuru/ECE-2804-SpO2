Code Guide:
All variables should be initialized at a known value until assigned a value by a constructor or function.
Try to comment on anything that is not obvious
Leave as few blank lines as possible (at most 1)
Simplify code, remove redundancies
When modifying libraries, use .cpp and .h files as intended
